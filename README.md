# N-puzzle_42

Program capable to solve n-puzzles of various sizes, as optimized as possible

# Objectives

The goal of this project is to solve the N-puzzle game using the A*
search algorithm or one of its variants.
The algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach the
final state, a.k.a the "snail solution", which depends on the size of the puzzle:

The only move one can do in the N-puzzle is to swap the empty cell with one of its
neighbors.
